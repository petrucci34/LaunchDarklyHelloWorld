### LaunchDarkly Sample iOS Application  ###
We've built a simple Swift application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.  Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/).

##### Build instructions  #####
1. Make sure you have [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12) installed
2. Run 'pod install' to get the latest iOS client integrated.
3. Open `hello-ios.xcworkspace` in XCode
4. Copy the mobile key from your account settings page into the `AppDelegate.swift`.
5. Copy the feature flag key from your LaunchDarkly dashboard into `ViewController.swift` 
6. Run your application through XCode.
7. Update the feature flags from your LaunchDarkly dashboard and the feature flag label in the view controller should update with the current value of the feature flag.
